When starting your printi mini for the first time, it will print instructions that look something like this:

```
This printi is not connected to the internet :(

=> Step 1:
On your phone/laptop, connect to the wifi network emitted by this printi:

      Name: printi-??????
  Password: 12345678

=> Step 2:
After connecting, open a web browser and navigate to:
http://192.168.3.1/

=> Step 3:
Type in the name and password of the WiFi network that you want your printi to connect to, and press Save.

Tip: The settings page can also be used to change the name of your printer! Store these instructions somewhere safe (or visit help.printi.me).

That's it! Happy printing!
```
