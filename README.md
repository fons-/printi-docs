don't panic!

## FAQ:

### Setup

How do I **connect my printi to a Wi-Fi network**?

> [Open the settings page of your printi mini](/settings).

Can I **update** the firmware of my printi mini?

> Yes! The firmware will be updated automatically when the printi _boots_, so restart (switch off/on) your printi every now and then to get the latest features!

How do I **change the printi name**?

> [Open the settings page of your printi mini](/settings).

### Trouble

ðŸš¨ What does a **flashing red LED** mean?

> You ran out of paper! Switch off your printi, lift the lid, and put in a new thermal paper roll: **width: 57mm, diameter: â‰¤60mm**. (They are sold at office supply stores.) VoilÃ !

My printi only prints blank paper!

> Make sure that you are using 58mm *thermal* receipt paper (does one side turn black quickly when you heat it?), and that the paper is not loaded in reverse.

My printi is **not receiving pictures**!

> Check that you are sending your pictures to the right address. For example, if your printer name is `apples`, you should go to `printi.me/apples` to send pictures. You can view or change your printer name using the [settings page](/settings). You could also try using a different printer name.

My printi doesn't do anything ðŸ˜¢

> Oh no! Remember that it might take up to five minutes for printi to boot and update. Is the [settings page](/settings) working? Feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/fons-)!

### Misc

Can I protect my printi mini with a **password**?

> No, but you can make your printi nearly impossible to find by choosing a complex name. Every `printi.me/subdomain` page looks exactly the same, and uploads are handled identically, regardless of whether it connects to a printi or not. 

Are images sent to a printi mini **stored on a server**?

> Never on a hard drive; (processed) photos are only stored in memory, and will be deleted when printed, or after 7 days, whichever comes first. 

What happens to images sent to `printi.me`?

> That's secret!

Where can I buy more **printi minis**?!
